# Kiosk Screen on your iOS Device
### Get Kiosk running on an iPad or iPhone

Whether you're on the go, working from home or just need an extra screen at your desk - it can be convenient to use your iPad or iPhone as a Kiosk screen. To make this as convenient as possible for you, we have developed a native iOS app.
