# The Kiosk dongle
### The easiest way to get Kiosk up on a wall is the Kiosk dongle

The most important goal for Kiosk is to make it possible for anyone to Kioskify a screen without being a techie. That's why we have developed our own plug'n'play hardware device which instantly gives any TV, projector or screen Kiosk super powers.
