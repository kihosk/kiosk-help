Databox has a "public url" function you can find by selecting databoards in the menu bar and then clicking the share button in the middle of your dashboard. In the screen that pops up, click the copy button on the right, and x out. After you've found and copied the link, head on over to your Kiosk page.

With the link copied to your clipboard, simply create a new show - and add a slide with the "Any Website" template. This allows you to to show any website from the internet on your Kiosk screen. Paste the link address into the URL field, and select the duration and Voil√†!
