Datapine has a "public url" function you can find by clicking on the share button in the upper right hand corner of your dashboard. In the screen that pops up, click the public URL button on the right, make sure the active switch is turned on, copy the link using the button and hit apply.  After you've found and copied the link, head on over to your Kiosk page.

With the link copied to your clipboard, simply create a new show - and add a slide with the "Any Website" template. This allows you to to show any website from the internet on your Kiosk screen. Paste the link address into the URL field, and select the duration and Voil√†!
